In the process of “moving” my photo workflow from the Adobe Creative Cloud to other apps like Photo/Pixelmator.

$60/year for Lightroom Mobile is pretty reasonable, but I can't afford it right now as I and the other contractors at work were furloughed for two and a half weeks in December, so I'm taking the opportunity to explore the other options. I'm locked in by choice to the Apple/iCloud ecosystem, so it makes sense in that way as well.
