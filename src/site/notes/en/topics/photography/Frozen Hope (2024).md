I am thrilled to be recognized as an Honorable Mention by [CENTRO](https://centropr.hunter.cuny.edu/) for my photo “Frozen Hope (2024),” which has been selected for the *[On Both Sides of the Lens: Documenting the Puerto Rican Diaspora](https://centropr.my.canva.site/on-both-sides-of-the-lens#on-both-sides-essay)* exhibition. 

My original description of this photo follows:

> This image captures a Puerto Rican flag, frozen by winter snowfall and ice, hanging in stark contrast against the cold night in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Far from the tropical warmth of Puerto Rico, the flag's vibrant reds and whites are muted by a layer of frost, symbolizing resilience and endurance in a foreign and frigid environment. The streetlight in the background casts a subtle glow, hinting at a sense of quiet hope amidst the chill. This photograph intends to reflect themes of displacement, identity, and the enduring spirit of the Puerto Rican people.

The [essay](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGW9O1TcyE/QNGfByUJ_iKivEwFQlTLQQ/view?embed) that goes along with the exhibition gives more insights about the photo, which is really appreciated.

> As a preface, Chris Vega’s *Frozen Hope* provides an entryway into the world that will unfold. A flag of Puerto Rico drapes over a wooden handrail, covered in frost, contrasted by the surrounding darkness of the night. An image like this can quickly establish a narrative for the viewer: This flag symbolizes a land that does not know winter. Nevertheless, perhaps the person who proudly raised it grew up watching the seasons change, dreaming about the islands their parents are from. The image evokes a suspended state, redolent of the sensations expressed by diasporic communities—when living in vaivén (to come and go), the body could be in one place while the heart is elsewhere. In his submission, Vega highlights the streetlight in the background shining through the somber surroundings, “It casts a subtle glow, hinting at a sense of quiet hope amidst the chill. This photograph intends to reflect themes of displacement, identity, and the enduring spirit of the Puerto Rican people.” With its ambiguous nature, containing recognizable signs, and its difficulty in pinpointing its location, the image acts as a portal into the complexities that define the diasporic existence.

This is the first time my work has been highlighted like this, and it's really exciting! I hope to do it again in the future.
