This is my [digital garden](https://cagrimmett.com/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/). 

After tinkering with a handful of other initial versions, I eventually found and generally followed [these steps](https://dudethatserin.com/intro-obsidian-digital-garden-series/) to set this up. The Obsidian “backend” I utilize is explained in-depth [here](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/).

Here are a few essential notes which apply to this site (which I own and manage) and to my other public social media accounts as well:
- This blog is not an open forum. I don't plan to add commenting functionality on this page as this is a digital garden and not a traditional blog. 
- If you have any feedback, please reply on any [platforms I post to](https://twop0intfive.xyz/social.html) or [contact me directly](https://www.twop0intfive.xyz/contact.html#reach-out).
