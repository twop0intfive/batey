It’s been a bit since I posted anywhere.

Not because I had to disappear, but because I’ve been pulled in about twelve different directions—work, school, life, grief, logistics. You know how it goes. But I’ve realized something: even though I don’t feel obligated to post, I do feel incomplete when I don’t share. Not for attention, but because sharing helps me make sense of what I’m doing. It’s part of the process.

This space, and others like it, are starting to feel more like an interface—a UI—for my creative life. An extension of the blog-brain I’m slowly rebuilding.

What’s been going on?
- I’ve been busy. Juggling corporate work, grad school, and what little free time I have left.
- I’ve been building a system to track and manage my creative ideas—something that helps me show up more often, more authentically.
- I’m thinking about content in layers now: how to diversify where I share and what I share—without diluting it.
- I’ve been drawing on some of the org & PM ideas from my job to bring structure into my creative work. And vice versa.
- I’m headed to Puerto Rico soon—my first visit in 18 years. It’s bittersweet. I was hoping to see my grandmother, but [she passed away](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJSjCRtNy9z/?igsh=YnpsaGZrZjg3ZmRv) roughly a month ago. Still, I’m looking forward to reconnecting with family, culture, and self. Hoping to come back broke but rich in experience.

There’s a shift happening. I feel it. I may be taking a more personal tone here going forward. Not because I’m trying to build a brand, but because the “professional” world feels increasingly surreal. Like [Severance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) or [The Morning Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7203552/), but worse—and I’ve spent 20 years inside it.

The essays by [Edward Zitron](https://www.wheresyoured.at/)—[The Rot Economy](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/), [The Shareholder Supremacy](https://www.wheresyoured.at/tss/), [The Era of the Business Idiot](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-era-of-the-business-idiot/)—are helping me reframe things. They pair beautifully with the MBA slop I’m currently required to read. (One for the cortex implant, one for the soul.) 

One of my favorite parts (so far) of the Era of the Business Idiot, likely in large part to having encountered many of them in recent former positions:

> A great example of our vibes-based society was back in October 2021, [where a Washington Post article written by two Harvard professors](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-new-anti-remote-propaganda-wants/) rallied against remote work [by citing a Microsoft-funded anti-remote study](https://www.wheresyoured.at/microsofts-meaningless-remote-work/) and quoting 130-year-old economist Alfred Marshall about how "workers gather in dense clusters," [ignoring the fact that Marshall was so racist they've had to write papers about it](https://www.academia.edu/4446735/Race_and_Nation_in_Marshalls_Histories?ref=wheresyoured.at), [how excited he was about eugenics](https://mises.org/wire/keynes-eugenics-race-and-population-control?ref=wheresyoured.at), **_or the fact he was writing about fucking factories._**
> 
> Remote work terrifies the Business Idiot, because it removes the performative layer that allowed them to stomp around and feel important, reducing their work to, well...work.[Office culture is inherently heteronormative and white](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-workers-prefer-remote-work-racist-office_l_60c8f805e4b0f7e7ccf59fa1?ref=wheresyoured.at), and [black women are less likely to be promoted by their managers](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/report-black-women-less-likely-to-be-promoted-supported-by-their-managers?ref=wheresyoured.at), and continuing the existence of "The Office" is all about making sure The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Removing the ability for the managerial hall monitors to look at you and try and work out what you're doing without ever really helping is a big part of being a manager — and if you're a manager reading this and saying you don't do this, I challenge you to talk to another person that doesn't confirm your biases.

I don’t know exactly what’s next in my career. But I do know I want flexibility. I want to position myself so that my experience and education aren’t just leveraged for shareholder gain or empty KPIs—but for something that actually matters. To my family. My community. Mi gente. P’al mundo.

More soon—from the past few months and from this trip.

Maybe nothing profound. But something real.
