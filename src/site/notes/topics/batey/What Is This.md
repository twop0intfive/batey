This is my digital garden. After tinkering with a handful of [other initial version]([[gh0stnode.twop0intfive.xyz/gh0stnode\|gh0stnode]]), I eventually found and generally followed [these steps](https://dudethatserin.com/intro-obsidian-digital-garden-series/) to set this up. The Obsidian backend is explained more in-depth [here]([https://dg-docs.ole.dev](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/)) . 

Here are a few important notes which apply to this site (which I own and manage) and to my other public social media accounts as well:
- this blog is not an open forum. I don't have any plans to add commenting functionality on this page as this is a digital garden and not a traditional blog. 
- If you have any feedback, please feel free to reply on any [platforms I post to](https://www.twop0intfive.xyz/#:~:text=Follow) or [contact me directly](https://www.twop0intfive.xyz/contact.html). 

Some reasons I might block or restrict your access to me include:  
- harassing me or anyone connected to me, in person or online, on my accounts, theirs, or my connectionsâ€™
- promoting actively harmful or hateful political, social, or religious agendas 
- expressing racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or xenophobia
