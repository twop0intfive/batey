Some tips on how to stay sane and keep your personal social media/entertainment consumption apolitical during (at least!) the US election season(s) especially in “battleground states” where special interests are doing everything they can to tell you how to vote:

- avoid AM/FM radio *(not difficult)*
- avoid cable *(I feel like this goes without saying, especially since who still pays for cable??)*
- don’t interact with political content on social media unless it’s from a throwaway account *(and make use of any platform features that restrict political content from being shown on your feed)*
- if you can, pay extra on streaming services for no ads *(take advantage of offers such as low-income, package, senior, student, or other discounts if you’re eligible!)*
- use a virtual phone number *(e.g. Google Voice)* for any kind of campaign-related communications you **do** want
- use the “Block and Mark As Spam” feature on your mobile device with unwanted texts to your main phone number 
- use tools such as Pi-Hole on your home network to block ads, spammy, and malicious network traffic from going to anything connected to your home WiFi *(there are numerous guides on these and alternate very low cost, only moderately technical solutions; plus, you can always utilize genAI to guide you with setup* **{note to self: write about my setup?}***)*
